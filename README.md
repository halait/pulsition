Real-time 2d physics engine for the web. Featuring low-level memory management that helps achieve relatively high frame-rates. Development is still active and many features are being added including arbitrary convex polygons.

Checkout my game at [https://buildhead.web.app/](https://buildhead.web.app/) to see it in action.
