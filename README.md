# Pulsition
A real-time 2D physics engine for the web. It can achieve relatively high frame-rates due to low-level memory access using typedArrays. Development is still active and many features are being added including arbitrary convex polygons.

Checkout my game at [https://buildhead.web.app/](https://buildhead.web.app/) to see it in action.
